# Workday-Scheduler

This is a simple 9-5 workaday calender application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. The Moment.js library was used to work with date and time. It should allow the user to input tasks and see the current hour.
